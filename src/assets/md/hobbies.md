I've been drawing in some form for as long as I can remember; in primary school I would often draw cartoons with my friends. I would carry this through to secondary school where I would express my love of cartoons and anime through trying to mimic the style of [popular japanese animation](https://trigger-global.ecq.sc/book.html) and [art](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d6da61c6a9dcca82300ce2164daac5b4/tumblr_ptu0f6iQ671rbya48o2_1280.png) (and more [art](https://twitter.com/rev_bmp)). 

I got my first digital drawing device [(Wacom Bamboo CTL-490)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wacom-Intuos-Draw-Tablet-White/dp/B013ATUR46) around the middle of secondary school and have been drawing digitally on-and-off ever since. I've tried to keep this up alongside my traditional art, and some of my favourite bits can be found on [my art Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elliotdraws/).
