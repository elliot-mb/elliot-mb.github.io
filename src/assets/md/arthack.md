# The event

My university decided to host a new event this term; an art contest called the "ArtHack". The intention was contestants would ptry to produce some piece of interactive media/sculpture/website etc. within 24 hours, during the weekend. \
There were something like 5 Â£100 prises up for grabs, all with their own winning categories. Furthermore there were themes *Order and Chaos* and *Dreams and Sleep* which contestants were suggested to base their ideas around. 

I however just decided to build what I wanted and tack the theme on later. Could this be a reason why what I made didn't win **any** catagories? Maybe...

## What I decided to make

As you may be aware from the title, I produced some sort of binary adder? What is that exactly? 

Conceptually a binary adder is fairly self-explanator; that which is able to add two binary numbers together and output the result. 

Making this mechanically sounded challenging, so I decided to see if anyone had done anything similar before. I found an extremely elegant design on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GcDshWmhF4A) made from plywood and nails.
Since I prefer to have a machine do as much work for me as possible, I created mine in a way that used lasercutting and 3D-printing as much as possible. 

All of this manufacturing was made possible by my faculty's free-to-use facilities (you don't even pay for the filament!)
